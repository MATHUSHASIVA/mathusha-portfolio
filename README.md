## Deploying this project (Netlify / Vercel / GitHub Pages)

This project is a standard Vite + React app. The default build output is the `dist/` folder.

Common hosting options and quick steps:

- Netlify (recommended for simplicity)
	1. Push your repo to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket.
	2. In Netlify, click "New site from Git" and connect your repo.
	3. Set the build command to `npm run build` and the publish directory to `dist`.
	4. (Optional) Add a `_redirects` or `netlify.toml` for SPA routing (this repo includes `netlify.toml`).

- Vercel
	1. Push your repo to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket.
	2. Import the project in Vercel and select the repo.
	3. Set the build command to `npm run build` and the output directory to `dist` (Vercel auto-detects Vite in most cases).
	4. This repo includes a `vercel.json` for static-build configuration.

- GitHub Pages
	- Option A (recommended if you want to keep things simple): Use Netlify or Vercel instead.
	- Option B: Build locally and push `dist/` to the `gh-pages` branch using a tool like `gh-pages` or a GitHub Actions workflow. Example using `gh-pages`:

		```sh
		npm run build
		npx gh-pages -d dist
		```

Notes:
- If you deploy to a subpath (e.g. GitHub Pages under `/REPO_NAME/`), set the Vite `base` option in `vite.config.ts` or run `vite build --base "/your-subpath/"`.
- SPA routing: ensure your host rewrites all 404s to `index.html` (Netlify `netlify.toml` or `_redirects`, Vercel routes, or GitHub Pages `404.html` rewrite).

Files added to help deployment:

- `netlify.toml` — Netlify build & redirect config (publishes `dist/`, SPA redirect).
- `vercel.json` — Vercel static-build config.

If you'd like, I can also add a GitHub Actions workflow that builds and deploys to GitHub Pages automatically, or create a `gh-pages` script in `package.json`. Tell me which provider you plan to use and I will wire it up.
